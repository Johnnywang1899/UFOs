# UFOs
JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS

# Overview
The project creates a dynamic table with filter enabled allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The filtering is controlled through JS and webpage is constructed using HTML and CSS formating. The main goal is to provide a more in-depth analysis to UFO's observations.  

# Results
Instructions:  
- When the webpage is loaded (without any filtering conditions applied), the entire table including all the incident details is shown.

- When an input is loaded in the "Filter Search" on the left, such condition will be applied to the table for update based on the condition. Below is an example when "Enter Date" filter is specified on "1/1/2010" (It can be observed from the sliding bar that data gets filtered).
